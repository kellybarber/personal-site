  about: 'I’m Kelly, a Web Developer who started off as a Political Science and Urban Planning major. While working in Banff after my degree, I stumbled across a book on startups in a local bookstore. I was captivated immediately, and knew I had to find a way into the industry. I first learned to code as a means to an end, but fell in love with it while taking a bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. I loved the feeling of finally solving a tough problem after hours of work, and there really are few things more gratifying than making ideas you’ve dreamt up come to life. The beauty of coding to me is the unique combination of immense creativity with strong logical structure, and the practicality of the final product. My main focus has been on web development and JavaScript. I have a good knowledge of Node.js, usually paired with Express, and have worked with React as well as vanilla JavaScript and jQuery for DOM manipulation. I also have experience with the Ruby language and Ruby on Rails, and have more recently begun to learn Swift for IOS development. However, JavaScript and the web remains my main focus and passion.'
