      <p>
        A front-end developer with experience working full-stack, I love building beautiful and functional 
        web apps. I have experience drafting themes and layouts and implementing them with CSS, as well as 
        experience building out complex modern front-end systems with JavaScript.
        <br/><br/>
        Experienced in both managing and working on teams in this and other industries, I am a strong team player
        with the ability to effectively lead and follow. I always take responsibility for projects I work on 
        and hold myself to a very high standard, I take personal pride in delivering the best possible product I can. 
        I love writing minimalist code and am always looking for ways to find the cleanest and simplest solutions 
        to complex problems. 
        <br/><br/>
        I bring an solid understanding of UX/UI and design principles partnered with technical prowess from working 
        on complex client and server-side JavaScript implementations. Coupled with my strong skills in teamwork and 
        leadership, I believe I can provide a unique and valuable skillset to any team.
